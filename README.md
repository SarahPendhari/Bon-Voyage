# Bon-Voyage
# A travel advisor application I made as a fun project while experimenting with APIs.
What all I've included(and learnt at the same time) :
1)Geolocation
2)Google Maps API 
3)Google Places API
4)Fetching API data based on the location
5)Data filtering
6)Fetching data from unlimited sources using RapidAPI
7)I also delved into React(that was definetely a ride)!
